```javascript
/**
* This function calculates the sum of two numbers.
*
* @param {number} a The first number.
* @param {number} b The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **`/** ... */`**: This is a multi-line comment block used for documenting the
function. It's a good practice to include such comments to explain what the
function does, what parameters it takes, and what it returns. This is especially
useful when working in teams or for your own future reference.
* **`@param {number} a`**: This line, within the comment block, specifies that
the parameter `a` is expected to be a number.
* **`@param {number} b`**: Similarly, this indicates that the parameter `b` is
also expected to be a number.
* **`@returns {number}`**: This specifies that the function will return a
number.
